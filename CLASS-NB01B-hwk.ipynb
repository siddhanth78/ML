    "# Homework: Sentiment analysis of product reviews (Part 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will explore logistic regression and feature engineering with scikit-learn functions. You will use product review data from Amazon to predict whether the sentiment about a product, inferred from its review, is positive ($+1$) or negative ($-1$). \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though more sophisticated approaches exist, such as tf-idf (discussed in module 1), for simplicity we'll use a bag-of-words representation as our feature matrix. If you need to review, feature extraction on text data was discussed in the first module of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to do the following:\n",
    "* Perform some basic feature engineering to deal with text data\n",
    "* Use scikit-learn to create a vocabulary for a corpus of reviews\n",
    "* Create a bag of words representation based on the vocabulary shared by the reviews\n",
    "* Train a logistic regression model to predict the sentiment of product reviews.\n",
    "* Inspect the weights (coefficients) of a trained logistic regression model.\n",
    "* Make a prediction (both class and probability) of sentiment for a new product review.\n",
    "* Given the computed weights, predictors and ground truth labels, write a function to compute the accuracy of the model.\n",
    "* Inspect the coefficients of the logistic regression model and interpret their meanings.\n",
    "* Compare multiple logistic regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, we import a few libraries we need. Later, you'll need to import more."

I never had to deal with changing cartridges but I can imagine how annoying it could be to open that stench-filled object and take out the poop sausage. I love my diaper champ. It's so easy to use. I never had a problem with it squishing my finger because I always remember that the lid is heavy. No smell escapes from it and I keep it in my bathroom.

I registered for the Diaper Champ primarily because you could use regular kitchen trash bags instead of special refills, and all the good reviews it seemed to get.  I could not be happier with the Champ!  It is truly the easiet thing in the world to use--one hand is all you need.  We have not noticed an odor problem at all.  Yes, it might briefly smell when you change out the pail but I can't imagine other systems aren't the same way.  I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone having a baby!  It is by far the best thing I received as a shower gift.  You won't be disappointed in the Champ!\n",

      " We did alot of research on diaper pails before our first child was born.  We knew a few couples with the Diaper Genie, and one couple with the Diaper Champ.  The couple with the Diaper Champ has a baby that is 3 months older than our child.  This couple liked their Champ just fine, saying they noticed no odors.  We also read tons of reviews, mainly here on Amazon, of both products.  And from the reviews, it seemed there were many happy customers of both products.  So we decided, if they were about equal, we would go with the more convenient and cheaper solution, the Champ.Well, we were pretty happy for about 4 to 6 months.  We very much liked that we could use our regular trash bags.  And changing the Champ's bag is very easy.  But after our child was well into eating solids, at about 7 months, the smell became unbearable.  It really is true that babies' poops really start to stink much, much worse when they eat lots of solids.  So we went out and bought a Diaper Genie, and are now very happy with the Genie.  The Genie has 2 big advantages over the Champ, in regards to smell control.  1) Each diaper is contained in its own litte pouch via the Genie's twisting mechanism.  2)  The filler bags progress in thickness, so as your child gets older, and her poops get smellier, you can get thicker, better bags.After using the Genie for about a month now, we are very pleased.  The Champ is essentially a simple waste pail with a fancy hood.  The hood and ordinary trash bags don't do much for odor prevention.  The drawbacks to the Genie though, are that you must buy their fillers, and the bag changing mechanism is much more complicated than the Champ's.  We thought these were worth dealing with to prevent the odors.\n"
